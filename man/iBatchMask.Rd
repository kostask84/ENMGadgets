For example, if the input asc files are bio1.asc, bio2.asc, and you select multiple shape files like shp1.shp, shp2.shp, shp3.shp, then 
3 folders named shp1, shp2 and shp3 will be created in output folder specified by user. Each folder will contain bio1.asc, bio2.asc
If by chance your files does not have any extension, then comment the statement below the note 'For file with extension'. 
and uncomment the FileName statement below the note 'For files without extension
